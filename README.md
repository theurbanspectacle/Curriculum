### Instructor Tips

1. Clone the Gitlab Repo today so you have all the materail for the rest of the course.
2. If you have a break available, use it. I can't tell you the amount of times I have spent half a day working on a problem, walked away for *__5 minutes__*, and come back with the solution.
3. Do not look at the solution files for any of the activities until you are absolutely certain you gave it your very best attempt. Remember, you paid for this class to get the most out of it. It won't serve you if you copy/paste the answers into your programs.
4. You have access to your Instructor and TAs 45 minutes before class and 30 minutes after. Use that time.
5. Pair Programming is an incredibly useful tactic for you to implement. Often times, you will not be coding alone. You will be on a team of people who are all working towards the same goal. And in many cases, this will involve some time of two people working from one computer. Choose a driver, the one who handles the keyboard. Choose a navigator, the one who gives direction and reviews the code as it is typed in. The one caviat is you *__must__* switch off frequently. 
6. Whenever you have a problem with your code, place a rubber duck on your desk and explain your code line by line to the duck. This is called [Rubber Duck Debugging (Rubber Ducking)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and it is a widely accepted way to debug your code. Often you find the answer to your problem in the midst of having to explain it. That's the idea behind this practice.
